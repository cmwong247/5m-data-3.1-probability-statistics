# Assignment

## Instructions

Complete the following exercises using Python.

1. **Probability and Expected Value**

   - Generate 10,000 random samples of flipping 3 coins (use `np.random.binomial()`)
   - Plot the probability distribution of getting 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads
   - Calculate the expected value (mean) of your distribution
   - Compare your empirical results with the theoretical probability for each outcome

2. **Normal Distribution and Statistical Testing**

   - Generate two samples from normal distributions:
     - Sample A: 100 values with mean=70, std=5
     - Sample B: 100 values with mean=73, std=5
   - Create a box plot comparing the two distributions
   - Conduct an independent t-test to determine if the means are significantly different
   - Calculate and visualize the 95% confidence intervals for both samples

3. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Using the iris dataset (from seaborn), analyze the relationship between:
     - Sepal length and petal length
     - Sepal width and petal width
   - For each pair:
     - Create a scatter plot
     - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value
     - Calculate and interpret the R-squared value
   - Which pair shows a stronger relationship? Explain why.
